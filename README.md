# Covid19Bot

<h2>AI Bot that provides information on COVID-19 Pandemic</h2>

This bot has been created using [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com), [LUIS.ai](https://www.luis.ai) and [QnAMaker.ai](https://www.qnamaker.ai) models for natural language processing (NLP).

Use the Dispatch model in cases when:

- Your bot consists of multiple language modules (LUIS + QnA) and you need assistance in routing user's utterances to these modules in order to integrate the different modules into your bot.
- Evaluate quality of intents classification of a single LUIS model.
- Create a text classification model from text files.
